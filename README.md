# grunt-override-config v0.1.0
Override grunt config task.


## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-override-config --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-override-config');
```


## Using Example

### Override JSHint options
Override grunt config with running CI.

```javascript
grunt.initConfig({
  // Default JSHint options.
  jshint: {
    options: {
      reporter: require('jshint-stylish')
    },
    all: [...]
  },

  // CI JSHint options.
  override: {
    jshint: {
      options: {
        reporter: 'checkstyle',
        reporterOutput: 'checkstyle.xml'
      }
    }
  });
```

Please run the "grunt jshint" always.

```
$ grunt jshint

app/scripts/main.js
